Although a compiled version of the program is provided, to compile the proxy, use the command - javac Proxy.java

To run the proxy, run the command - java Proxy [DOMAIN, PORT]
			       e.g. java Proxy www.bom.gov.au 80
	If no domain and port are spesified, the program will default to running www.bom.gov.au on port 80.


After the program is running, navigate to localhost through a web browser.
