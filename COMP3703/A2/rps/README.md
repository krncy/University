# rps

This is a game of Rock, Paper and Scissors! You can play a game with the computer, but winning a game does not give you the flag. Instead, exploit a heap vulnerability in the binary to capture the flag. Use the provided template python script (`solve_rps.py`) to automate your attack. 

## Specific requirements

Your solution must use a heap-based exploitation technique to obtain the flag.
